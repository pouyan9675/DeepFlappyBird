DeepFlapPyBird is a project that trains an agent using Deep Q-Learning to play flappybird game. Despite many
other existed versions, this project does not use the game frames images as input and it is implemented inside
the game and it will get the observations with the help of a custom gym environment.

This project is a modified clone of [FlaPyBird](https://github.com/sourabhv/FlapPyBird) repository.
